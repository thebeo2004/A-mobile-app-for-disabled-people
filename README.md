## Introduction
Our team has developed this project to provide VIPs with enhanced proactivity in their interactions. The app consists of two primary modes, each featuring different functionalities. 

The first mode, called **Explore Mode**, allows users to actively identify objects in their surroundings and gather detailed information, such as color and size, through PaliGemma. This mode includes three features: **Object Detection**, **Danger Warning**, and **Explore Surroundings**.

The second mode, called **Socializing Mode**, focuses on enhancing social interactions and includes two features: **Mood Tracking** and **Face Recognition**.

Modes are navigated between each other by sliding vertically on the screen, while functions within the same mode are switched back and forth by sliding horizontally on the screen.
